        "\n",
        "* Here is an example of inheritance. Let's say we have a class called Animal. This class has some properties, such as name, age, and species. It also has some methods, such as eat(), sleep(), and makeSound().\n",
        "\n",
        "  We can then create a new class called Dog that inherits from the Animal class. This means that the Dog class will have all of the properties and methods of the Animal class. In addition, the Dog class can also have its own properties and methods.\n",

It allows developers to define a base class with common functionality and then create derived classes that add or override certain properties or methods. This can save time and effort in developing new classes, as well as promote consistency across an application."

        "\n",
        "  Single inheritance refers to the concept of a class inheriting properties and methods from a single parent class. In other words, a subclass can only inherit from one superclass. This creates a linear hierarchy of classes, with each subclass inheriting from its parent class. Single inheritance is simple and easy to understand, which makes it a popular choice for many programming languages.\n",

This creates a more complex hierarchy of classes, with each subclass inheriting from multiple superclasses. Multiple inheritance can be useful in situations where a class needs to have characteristics from multiple sources, but it can also be more difficult to implement and maintain.\n",

The base class provides a set of properties and methods that can be inherited by the new class, which is known as a derived class (also known as a child class or subclass).\n",

This promotes code reusability and makes it easier to maintain and modify code in the future.\n",

A derived class called \"Car\" could access and modify the \"fuelLevel\" property, but other classes outside the \"Vehicle\" hierarchy would not be able to access it.
